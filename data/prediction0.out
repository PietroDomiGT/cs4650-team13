amendment and veto during the legislative process . according to the treaty on european union articles 9 and 10 , the eu observes \" the principle of equality of its citizens \" and is meant to be founded on \" representative democracy \" . in practice , equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the parliament can not initiate legislation against the commission 's wishes , citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in parliament as citizens of the largest countries , and \" qualified majorities \" or consensus of the council are required to legislate . the justification for this \" democratic deficit \" under the treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the european economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts , while popular understanding of the eu developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war . over time , this has meant the parliament gradually assumed more voice : from being an unelected assembly , to its first direct elections in 1979 , to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process . citizens ' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all european member states : under teu article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the commission with one million signatures . tfeu article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the parliament on issues which affect them . parliament elections , take place every five years , and votes for members of the european parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote . there are 750 meps and their numbers are \" degressively proportional \" according to member state size . this means - although the council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states . meps divide , as they do in national parliaments , along political party lines : the conservative european people 's party is currently the largest , and the party of european socialists leads the opposition . parties do not receive public funds from the eu , as the court of justice held in parti \u00e9cologiste \" les verts \" v parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states . the parliament 's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an ombudsman pending any court proceedings . it can require the commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole commission ( as happened to the santer commission in 1999 ) . in some cases , the parliament has explicit consultation rights , which the commission must genuinely follow . however its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the commission and council", "56e0b94b7aa994140058e6bb": "electricity supply system", "57268bf9dd62a815002e890c": "justice", "56d9c455dc89441400fdb7c5":
